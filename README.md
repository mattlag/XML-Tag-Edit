# XML-Tagger
A nice way to look at an XML file, make some edits, and 
download an updated XML file or generate a JSON file.

You can play with it live here: [mattlag.com/xmltagger](https://www.mattlag.com/xmltagger/)

# Version 1 can:
 - View an XML file you upload
 - Expand / Collapse
 - Edit text node values, attributes, and comments
 - Save as XML or export as JSON

# Probably V2
 - Edit tag names
 - Change the order of tags
 - Compare two XML files
